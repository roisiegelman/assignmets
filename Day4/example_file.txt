This work aims to identify the DNA restriction patterns shown
 by isolates of Aeromonas hydrophila. To achieve this objective, the researchers employed restriction fragment analysis on a sample of genomic DNA from Aeromonas derived from human subjects. The biological significance of this work lies in the presence of these bacteria in a diverse range of retail food products, which may serve as sources of human infection, leading to symptoms such as diarrhea and extraintestinal symptoms, including meningitis and endocarditis. They found that each of the eight strains they examined yielded a unique combination of DNA fragments. The authors propose that this approach has the potential to be employed for the examination of Aeromonas infections in both humans and animals.
After conducting an in-depth review and careful deliberation, I have decided to approve the article upon revisions since biological questions and techniques are significant. Additional effort is required and detailed below. 
Title: The title is acceptable. The text is both informative and concise.
 The title provides a clear and comprehensive explanation of the technical aspects of the work. Nevertheless, in my perspective, it fails to indicate their research's primary findings or biological significance.
Abstract: The abstract promptly outlines the primary methodology and sources of samples employed in the project. However, the abstract lacks 1-2 introductory sentences that address unknown information or highlight the novelty of the work. The comprehensive findings provided are informative, if excessively extensive, as they covered every band observed on the gel. The concluding sentence of the abstract effectively elucidates the authors' interpretation of the consequences of this study—the subsequent parts address whether I agree with them.
Introduction: The introduction starts effectively by addressing the subject matter that serves as the foundation for this research or the significance of this research. Following an introduction to the overall subject, the article focuses on Aeromonas hydrophila, providing comprehensive information about the organism. The health implications associated with Aeromonas are adequately elucidated. Before delving into the techniques and findings, the authors should have comprehensively explained the significance of differentiating between various strains, specifically whether different strains elicit distinct symptoms. Do various strains necessitate distinct treatments? Following the sentence, " Recently, DNA studies by Agarose Gel Electrophoresis (AGE) have shown that Aeromonas hydrophila have slight variations in genotypic traits," The authors ought to have provided further elaboration on the topic and elucidated the novel insights they intend to unveil. The utilization of references in the introduction is a matter of concern since it is noteworthy that out of the nine references, 
five are from papers published in the preceding millennium.
Methods: The methodologies are adequately described from a technical perspective. The cells' origins and the procedures' citations are provided, along with a comprehensive description in the authors' own words. The section on Restriction Digestion and AGE delivers a clear and thorough explanation. Nevertheless, the experiment lacks untreated control samples. For each sample treated with Bam H1, an untreated sample from the same source should be run on the gel in parallel. That way, each sample will show the native and fragmented DNA. By doing so, we can ensure that the bands are a direct consequence of the digestion process and not a by-product originating from an unknown reason. Furthermore, no explanation has been given for the authors to use only the Bam H1. A more comprehensive analysis can be done by utilizing additional restriction enzymes.
Finally, the authors chose to utilize a 0.8% agarose gel. 
Increasing the agarose % can lead to improved separation and the potential appearance of additional bands.
Results: The results are described thoroughly from a technical standpoint. However, the authors decided to detail the sample loaded in each lane and the molecular weight of each band in the ladder lane in the text and not as part of the figure itself. This decision makes it more challenging to analyze the results in the figure correctly. The authors could have written the sample name atop each lane of the gel, and instead of writing the letter designated for each band of the ladder, they could have written the molecular weight.
Discussion: The authors begin the discussion
 by outlining the primary procedure that the samples underwent in the study and elucidating the principal findings. According to the authors, samples that exhibit similar restriction patterns are more closely genetically related. Their assertion is grounded in the evidence that previous studies have shown that DNA fragments display patterns that mirror the genetic traits of a particular organism, as well as its connection to other microbes. What references support this statement? The authors also assert that the approach employed can accurately identify evolutionary divergences in cases of mutation. The writers should explain the feasibility of achieving the desired outcome alone by implementing restriction reaction and electrophoresis. 
Conclusions and recommendations: This brief segment seems redundant as it lacks informative content and fails to conclude the paper on a positive or impactful note.
