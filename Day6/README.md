The script that I have written takes an excel file that contains results from RNA sequencing (MARS seq) that compares two groups:

WT_PyMT: No.I and WT.sc
NSD1-KO: KO.2 and KO.3
I wanted to create a barplot that shows the top 10 genes with the highest fold-change for each group.
the genes were first filtered for significance (P value <0.05)
